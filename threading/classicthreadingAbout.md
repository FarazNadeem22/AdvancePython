## Explanation of the Program

The given Python script demonstrates the use of the `threading` module to create and start threads for concurrent execution of tasks. Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

### Importing Necessary Libraries:

The script imports required libraries:
- `time`: Used for time-related functions.
- `threading`: Provides support for working with threads for concurrent execution.

### Function Definition (`worker`):

- **Task Simulation**: The `worker` function simulates a task by introducing a 1-second delay using `time.sleep(1)`.
- **Completion Message**: Prints a completion message including the name provided as an argument.

### Thread Creation and Execution:

- **Thread Creation**: Creates two threads (`threadOne` and `threadTwo`) using the `Thread` class from the `threading` module.
- **Target Function**: Assigns the `worker` function as the target for both threads. The function invocation with arguments occurs during thread creation (Note: the function is not passed as a reference).
- **Thread Start**: Initiates the execution of `threadTwo` and `threadOne` using the `start()` method.

### Thread Execution Flow:

- **Function Invocation**: The function `worker` is immediately executed during the thread creation phase rather than during thread execution, due to incorrect usage of the `target` argument. As a result, the function is invoked in the main thread.
- **Print Statements**: During the creation of threads (`threadOne` and `threadTwo`), the `worker` function is called with respective names ("Thread two" and "Thread one") and completion messages are printed immediately.

### Expected Behavior:

- The code's intention appears to create two threads that execute the `worker` function concurrently. However, due to incorrect usage of the `target` argument by invoking the function during thread creation, the code does not achieve the intended multithreading behavior.
- As a result, the completion messages for both "Thread two" and "Thread one" are printed sequentially in the main thread.

The program aims to demonstrate threading by creating multiple threads for concurrent execution of tasks. However, the incorrect usage of the `target` argument leads to unexpected behavior, resulting in sequential execution instead of concurrent execution.
