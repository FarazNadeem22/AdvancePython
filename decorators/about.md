## Explanation of the Program

The provided Python script demonstrates the usage of functions, decorators, user input handling, and command-line argument passing. Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

### Decorator Function (timed):

The `timed` decorator function measures the execution time of a given function by recording the start and stop times. It prints the time taken for the decorated function to execute.

### calculateFactorial Function (Decorated):

The `calculateFactorial` function is a decorated function that computes the factorial of a given number. It utilizes the `timed` decorator to measure its execution time.

### getChoice Function:

The `getChoice` function prompts the user to decide whether to print large factorials. It takes user input to determine whether to display the computed factorial.

### main Function:

- **Factorial Computation**: Invokes the `calculateFactorial` function to compute the factorial of a provided command-line argument.
- **Factorial Size Check**: Determines if the computed factorial is larger than 10^100.
- **User Interaction**: Based on the factorial size, asks the user if they wish to print the large factorial to the screen.
- **Output Handling**: Prints either the computed factorial or a farewell message to the screen based on the user's choice.

### if __name__ == "__main__":

This block serves as the entry point of the script. It retrieves the command-line argument, converts it to an integer, and passes it to the `main` function to start the program's execution flow.

The program illustrates a factorial calculation with time measurement, user interaction for handling large outputs, and proper execution flow control through function calls and command-line argument processing.
