## myGenerator Function: 
This function generates square numbers up to a given limit. It's a generator function that yields the square of each number from 0 up to the given 'number'.

## infinite_sequence Function: 
This function generates an infinite sequence by continually multiplying the result by 10 and yielding it. It starts with '1' and multiplies it by 10 indefinitely.

## Loop to Generate and Print Values: 
It iterates over a range from 0 to 11, creating 'myGenerator' objects for each value in the range. It then iterates through the values generated by each 'myGenerator' object and prints them. It introduces a 0.25-second delay after printing each set of values.

## Creating 'sequence' and Printing Values: 
It creates an instance 'sequence' of the 'infinite_sequence' generator and prints the next four values generated by calling the next() function.
